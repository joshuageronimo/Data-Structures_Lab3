## Prefix Expression Evaluation Using Recursion

In this lab I wrote a program to validate and evaluate prefix expressions recursively.

Prefix notation also known as Polish notation, is a form of arithmetic expressions invented by Polish mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz in the 1920's. When using prefix notation, the instruction (operation) precedes the data (operands). It is similar to postfix notation, except that in prefix notation the operator comes before the operand. As in postfix notation, in prefix notation the order of operations and operands determines the result. There are no precedence rules or parentheses. An example of a prefix expression is + * 2 3 5, which is equivalent to the infix expression 2 * 3 + 5.
